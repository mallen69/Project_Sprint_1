End of Sprint Survey, Biases, and Data Formats

Sprint 1 - As a Technology Instructor: I need to understand the basic terminology and structure of data from End of Course Surveys from SurveyMonkey so I can apply statistical analyses in the future. I also need to understand the story of where the data came from (potential biases) so I know how it may be relevant to my action or recommendation.

Project Description: To determine if the raw "End of Training Course Survey" Data from SurveyMonkey can be Exported / Worked with in R for Future Statistical Analysis.  To understand the potential biases from survey particpants and survey designers.


Designed Version 1.0 "End of Sprint Survey" in SurveyMonkey. Documented potential participant and survey designer biases which may come into play when creating and filling out an End-of-Course Survey. Generated mock data by filling out the "End of Sprint Survey" in SurveyMonkey multiple times.  Analysed End of Sprint Survey data in SurveyMonkey.

Exported End of Sprint Survey data to Excel. Replaced the Excel categorical data to numerical data for future statistical analyses as indicated below:

Strongly Agree 		= 40
Agree			= 30
Disagree 		= 20
Strongly Disagree	= 10

Opened and Saved Converted Excel Data to a CSV file. Set the proper working directory in R and then read the CSV file into R. 
Annotated both the CSV file and R file and created mind mapping concepts for the CSV and R file data.
